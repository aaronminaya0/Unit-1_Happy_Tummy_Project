        <p><h2 id = "firstp">Why Nutrition is Important:</h2>
Most people know good nutrition and physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight. But the benefits of good nutrition go beyond weight.<br> <h4>Good Nutrition Can Help:</h4>

Reduce the risk of some diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, stroke, some cancers, and osteoporosis
Reduce high blood pressure
Lower high cholesterol
Improve your well-being
Improve your ability to fight off illness
Improve your ability to recover from illness or injury
Increase your energy level
What is good nutrition?
Good nutrition means your body gets all the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals it needs to work its best. Plan your meals and snacks to include nutrient-dense foods that are also low in calories.<br>

<h4>Tips for Eating Well:</h4>


Eat plenty of fruit
To get the benefit of the natural fiber in fruits, you should eat fruit whole rather than as juices.



Eat plenty of vegetables
Eat a variety of colors and types of vegetables every day.



Eat plenty of whole grains
At least half of the cereals, breads, crackers, and pastas you eat should be made from whole grains.



Choose low fat or fat free milk
These provide calcium and vitamin D to help keep your bones strong.



Choose lean meats
Lean cuts of meat and poultry have less fat and fewer calories but are still good sources of protein.



Try other sources of protein
Try replacing meats and poultry with fish, beans, or tofu.</p>
